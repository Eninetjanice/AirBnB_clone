# AirBnB clone - The console
## An ALX Team Project by [Eninet Janice] (https://github.com/Eninetjanice) and [Mickeywonders] (https://github.com/Mickeywonders)

## This project is targeted at writing a command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects.
### It is the first step towards building our first full web application. Here, we:
* put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
* create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
* create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

### This project also makes use of a command interpreter.
A command interpreter is referred to as is a blanket term for a certain class of programs designed to read lines of text entered by a user.
It is any program that accepts input commands, understand and executes it.
In Python, one can give a Python program a shell interface by using the Cmd public class of the cmd Python module.
Usage example = type Python3 on the terminal
